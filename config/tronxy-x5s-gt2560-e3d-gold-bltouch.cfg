# This file contains common pin mappings for ULTIMAKER/GT2560 rev.A
# boards. ULTIMAKER/GT2560 boards typically use a firmware compiled for the AVR
# atmega2560 (though other AVR chips are also possible).

[servo bltouch]

minimum_pulse_width: 0.0006
maximum_pulse_width: 0.0024

# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height
# probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and
# QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. The probe
# section also creates a virtual probe:z_virtual_endstop pin. One may
# set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian style
# printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop.
[probe]
pin: ar30
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 80.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
z_position: 0
#   The Z position to command the head to move to during a PROBE
#   command. The default is 0.

  SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=10
  SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=60
  G4 P200


#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute prior to each
#   probe attempt. This may be useful if the probe needs to be
#   activated in some way. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on activation.

deactivate_gcode: 
  SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=90

#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line) to execute after each
#   probe attempt completes. The default is to not run any special
#   G-Code commands on deactivation.

# Bed tilt compensation. One may define a [bed_tilt] config section to
# enable move transformations that account for a tilted bed.
[bed_tilt]
#x_adjust: -0.006914
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the X
#   axis. The default is 0.
#y_adjust: 0.003292
#   The amount to add to each move's Z height for each mm on the Y
#   axis. The default is 0.
# The remaining parameters control a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that may be used to calibrate appropriate x and y
# adjustment parameters.

#    A newline separated list of X,Y points that should be probed
#    during a BED_TILT_CALIBRATE command. The default is to not enable
#    the command.
speed: 90
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the
#   calibration. The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
probe_z_offset: 5
#   The Z height (in mm) of the head when the probe triggers. The
#   default is 0.
#manual_probe: true
#   If true, then BED_TILT_CALIBRATE will perform manual probing. If
#   false, then a PROBE command will be run at each probe
#   point. Manual probing is accomplished by manually jogging the Z
#   position of the print head at each probe point and then issuing a
#   NEXT extended g-code command to record the position at that
#   point. The default is false if a [probe] config section is present
#   and true otherwise.
